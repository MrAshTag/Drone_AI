# Drone_Faults_Anomaly_Dectection


#In this project we look at diagnostics data collected on Carbon Z drones to build a machine learning model to predict and predict faults and anomalies on the drone and prevent accidents and losses resulting from such crashes.
This model will prevent accident and injuries related to autonomous drones falling because there are multiple actions 
that can be taken in before a drone completely loses controle.
