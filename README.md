# Drone_Faults_Anomaly_Dectection


#In this project we look at diagnostics data collected on Carbon Z drones to build a machine learning model that would predict faults and anomalies on carbon Z drone.
This model will prevent accidents and injuries related to autonomous drones crashing because multiple actions 
could be taken before a drone loses complete controle.
